    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Mix everything well and marinate the chicken. Cover and set this aside for 1 hour. You can also rest it overnight.
    <p>Stir and taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Pour 2 cups of this hot
        water across the sides of the cooker or pot. Pour rest of the water over the rice gently. (check video)

    <p>Level the rice gently on top. Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves.Do not mix up everything, the taste of the
        biryani cooked in the shown method is good. Optionally you can sprinkle 2 tablespoons fried onions & saffron
        soaked milk adding fried onions mint</p>
    <p>Finally cover the pot or cooker.
        If cooking in a pot, cook on a medium heat until the rice is cooked completely. If the rice is undercooked &
        there is no more water left at the bottom of the pot, pour ¼ to ½ cup boiling water at this stage. How much
        water to add depends on the quality of basmati rice. Cook covered until the biryani rice is perfectly done,
        grainy and fully cooked. Rest it covered for 15 mins.</p>
    <p>If cooking in a cooker, cook until you hear 1 whistle. Later remove the cooker from the hot burner to stop
